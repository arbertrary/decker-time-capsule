# Blank Text/Multiple Choice

``` {.markdown}
{blanktext} Optional Title
: Decker is a software built using the programming language 
{Scala|!Haskell|Java|Ruby} and builds upon

# Blank Text/Multiple Choice

{blanktext} Optional Title
:   Decker is a software built using the programming language {Scala\|!Haskell\|Java\|Ruby} and builds upon {LaTeX Beamer\|!RevealJS\|PowerPoint}.

{blanktext}

# "Fill-in-the-blank" questions/Cloze tests

You can also add actual blank texts by providing only one option inside the curly brackets. Or combine both.

``` {.markdown}
{blanktext}
: These tests are called {Cloze} tests and are {!useful|useless}. 
```

{blanktext}
:   These tests are called {Cloze} tests and are {!useful\|useless}.

# Matching Questions Syntax

-   This type of questions asks to create pairs by dragging each element from a number of elements to the corresponding area.
-   Currently only supports exact 1:1 pairing.

``` {.markdown}
{match} A
: pair with A

{match} Haskell
: ![](img/haskell.png)

...
```

# Matching Questions

{match} A
:   pair with A

{match} Haskell
:   ![](img/haskell.png)

{match} B
:   drag to B

{match} decker
:   [decker](http://go.uniwue.de/decker)

{match} C
:   $\Leftarrow$ C

# Freetext Questions Syntax

-   Freetext questions consist of a bullet list of two elements with specific syntax
-   Two separate questions have to be separated for example by using a level two header

``` {.markdown}
* {?} Question text
* {!} Correct solution

## 

* {?} Question 2
* {!} Answer
```

# Freetext Questions {layout="columns"}

##  {.left}

-   {?} $2*2=~?$

##  {.right}

* {X} correct answer
* { } wrong answer again
```
