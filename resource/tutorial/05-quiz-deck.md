# Introduction

This slide deck shows how to create simple quizzes with different question types for a self-learning scenario.


# Quiz Syntax

## Class definition

For each question type you can use either of the three tags to create quizzes

```
.quiz-match-items, .quiz-mi, .qmi

.quiz-multiple-choice, .quiz-mc, .qmc

.quiz-insert-choices, .quiz-ic, .qic 

.quiz-free-text, .quiz-ft, .qft
```

# Basic syntax

Questions are defined by level 2 headers. That means creating a question **needs**

```
## Question title {.qmc}
```

(where `.qmc` can be replaced by any of the other quiz classes)


The quiz syntax is based on the markdown task list syntax. A markdown task list looks like this

```
- [ ] This box is not checked
- [X] This box is checked
- [ ] Another unchecked box
```

You can add tooltips by creating a nested list e.g.

```
- [ ] A
  - tooltip A
- [X] B
  - tooltip B
```

# Quiz Meta

Add a `YAML` code block to a question to provide meta information on the specific question.

This is work in progress. Currently it does not do anything. (17. Apr 2020)
````
``` {.yaml}
score: 5
category: FP
lectureId: fp1
topic: Functional Programming Introduction
```

# Insert Choice Example {.sub}

These questions generate quizzes where a user can drag and drop items to sort them into "buckets".

This uses the Pandoc [definition list syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists).

You can provide distractor items (items not belonging to any bucket) or empty buckets (no item belonging in those empty buckets) by using the exclamation mark "!".

# Matching Questions {.sub}

```
## Matching Question {.qmi}

Question text

BucketA
: A1
: A2

BucketB
: B1

!
: Distractor

Empty Bucket
: !
```

# Matching Questions Example

## Matching Question {.qmi}

Question text

BucketA
: A1
: A2

BucketB
: B1

!
: Distractor

Empty Bucket
: !

# Multiple Choice Questions

Classic multiple choice questions

```
## Multiple Choice Question {.qmc}

Which of these letters is the second in the alphabet?

- [ ] A
  - nope
- [X] B
  - yes
```

# Multiple Choice Questions Example {.sub}

## Multiple Choice Question {.qmc}

Question text

- [ ] A
  - nope
- [X] B
  - yes

# InsertChoices Questions

This will create a sort of blank text questions.
If multiple items are provided in the task list, they will be rendered as a drop down menu where the user can click answers.

If only one item/solution is provided it will be rendered as a blank.

```
## Insert Choices Question {.qic}

- [X] A
  - of course
- [ ] B 
  - uhm ...

is the first letter in the ABC. The second one is

- [ ] B
  - yep

```

# InsertChoices Questions Example {.sub}

## Insert Choices Question {.qic}

- [X] A
  - of course
- [ ] B 
  - uhm ...

is the first letter in the ABC. The second one is

- [ ] B
  - yep


# FreeText questions

This will create a simple input field/text box where the user can write their answer.

```
## FreeText Question TL {.qft}

What's the first letter in the alphabet?

- A
  - yep
- B
  - nope

## {.qft}

What's the fourth letter?

- [ ] C
- [X] D

```

# FreeTExt Question Example {.sub}

## FreeText Question TL {.qft}

What's the first letter in the alphabet?

- A
  - yep
- B
  - nope

## {.qft}

What's the fourth letter?

- [ ] C
- [X] D
