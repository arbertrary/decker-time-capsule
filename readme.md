# decker

A markdown based tool for slide deck creation.

## Installation

Pick a [published release](), download and unpack:

```{.sh}
gunzip decker.gz
chmod a+x decker
```

## Installation from source

1.  Install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (for `npm`) and [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) (Mac: `brew install sassc`, Linux: available for most package managers)
2.  Clone this repo.
3.  `cd decker`
4.  `git submodule update --init --recursive`
5.  `make install`

## Installation from source on Windows

Instead of a `makefile` we use a PowerShell script on Windows to install decker from source

1. `cd decker`
2. `.\bin\build.ps1`

If you want to copy `decker` to `C:\Program Files (x86)` you can call `.\bin\build.ps1 -local`. This needs a PowerShell session with administrator rights.

To then call decker from anywhere on the PowerShell command line create a PowerShell profile file, add the following line, and restart your PowerShell session!

`$Env:Path += ";${Env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Decker\bin"`

## Development

### Haskell

Use appropriate tooling. I use:

- _Visual Studio Code_ with the following plugins:
  - _Haskell Language Server_
  - _hindent-format_

### Templates and CSS

To interactively work on the template, CSS and Javascript files in
`resource/template` and `resource/support` run Decker as
`stack run decker server`. This will automatically incorporate all changes and
reload the documents in the browser.

## External tools

Decker uses a few external tools that need to be installed on the system:

- [_ssh_](https://www.openssh.com) for publishing slide decks and resources
- [_rsync_](http://formulae.brew.sh/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/formula/rsync)
  for publishing slide decks and resources
- [_LaTeX_ with pdflatex](https://www.latex-project.org) to generate LaTeX in
  PDF-files and embedded Tikz figures
- [_Graphviz_](http://graphviz.org) to generate graphs using `dot`
- [_Gnuplot_](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net) to generate graphs using `dot`
- [_pdf2svg_](https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg) to generate SVG files from
  PDF documents
- _libbzip2-dev_
- [_NodeJS_](https://nodejs.org/) to install JavaScript dependencies
- [_coreutils_](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) the GNU coreutils

### Installation of external tools on macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install most of them.

```{.sh}
brew install rsync graphviz gnuplot pdf2svg yarn coreutils
```

For the rest follow instructions on their respective webites.

## Usage

_decker_ behaves very much like a build tool. It works recursively on the
current directory and all subdirectories. Markdown files ending on `.md` in
those directories are processed and converted to either a reveal.js slide show,
a HTML document, or a PDF document, depending on the file name.

- `*-deck.md`

  Files with this ending are processed as silde decks. From one source file
  potentially four different targets can be generated:

  - `*-deck.html` A reveal.js based slide show
  - `*-handout.hmtl` A HTML document containing the speaker notes to the
    slide show.
  - `*-deck.pdf` A PDF version of the slide show
  - `*-handout.pdf` A PDF version of the handout

- `*-page.md`

  Markdown files ending on `*-page.md` are translated into corresponding HTML
  or PDF documents.

## _decker_ targets

- `decker version`

  Prints the current decker version and branch as well as the current pandoc
  version.

- `decker info`

  Prints information about the current project's directories, the targets
  (files which will be generated) and the meta data options which are found in
  top level `decker.yaml` file.

- `decker html`

  Builds HTML versions of all available documents.

- `decker decks`

  Builds only HTML slide decks.

- `decker pdf`

  Builds PDF versions of all documents.

- `decker pdf-decks`

  Builds PDF versions of all slide decks.

  To use `decker pdf` or `decker pdf-decks`, Google Chrome has to be
  installed.\
  **Windows:** Currently `decker pdf` does not work on Windows. Please add
  `print: true` or `menu: true` to your slide deck and use the print button in
  the menu or on the title slide. **MacOS:** Follow the Google Chrome
  installer instructions. **Google Chrome.app** has to be located in either
  `/Applications/Google Chrome.app` or
  `/Users/username/Applications/Google Chrome.app` Alternatively you can add
  `chrome` to `$PATH`.\
  **Linux:** `chrome` has to be on `$PATH`.

- `decker watch`

  Builds HTML versions of all documents and then watches for document changes.
  Each change to a watched document triggers a rebuild. Watching can be
  terminated with `^C`.

- `decker server`

  Like `decker watch`. Additionally a local web server is started that serves
  the generated HTML files. The `*-deck.html` file is openend in the browser.
  Changed files are reloaded in the browser. (still requires `livereloadx`)

- `decker example`

  Write a few example files to the current directory. To start exploring
  decker type

  ```{.bash}
  $ decker example
  $ decker server
  ```

  and make some changes to the Markdown files. `example-deck.md` contains the
  source code for a slide deck that explains most of the available features
  for creating slide decks.

- `decker tutorial`

  Like `example` but copies extended example/tutorial slide decks to the
  current directory.

- `decker clean`

  Recursively removes all generated files from the current directory (i.e.Â the
  `public` folder). Also removes cached resources witch version number lower
  than the current version.

- `decker publish`

  Publish the generated files to a remote location using `rsync` if the
  location is specified in the meta data. The keys `rsync-destination.host`
  and `rsync-destination.path` specify the publishing destination.

## Contributions

### Pull requests

Contributions are accepted via pull requests. Before working on a feature,
please write up an issue and discuss it with the other developers. For each
implemented feature, increment the version number in `package.yaml`. Breaking
changes increment the second number. Fixes increment the third number.

### CI build checks

The decker repository has a GitLab CI runner configured, that builds and runs
all tests for each commit on every branch. Look at the status display for recent
run of the [CI pipelines](pipelines).

### Haskell source code formatting

Haskell soure code readability depends heavily on consistent formatting
conventions. With decker, formatting is automated using the excellent
[hindent]() tool. Formatting is checked for each commit that is uploaded to the
GitLab repository.
