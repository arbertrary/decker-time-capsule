# Design documents

These are drafts for design documents that try to reconcile the complex connections between several important and interconnected aspects of the future decker development process and architecture:

-   [Release process and versioning](release-policy-page.md)
-   [Packaging and distribution](packaging-page.md)
-   [Resource handling](resource-handling-page.md)
-   [Graphical user interface architecture](gui-architecture-page.md)

Many aspects first discussed in #73 are addressed here. These documents are meant as a starting point for discussion and will evolve over time.
